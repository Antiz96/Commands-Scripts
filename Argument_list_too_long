#When there's too much files in a directory (usually +10 000), somes Linux commands doesn't work anymore
#Here's a useful command to bypass this limitation (the idea is to execute the command on each files separetly instead of execute it on all files at the same time)

for i in `ls /path/`; do command /path/$i; done

#Example with a "chown" command
for i in `ls /path/`; do chown root:root /path/$i; done

#Alternatively, you can copy the file list to a file and use a while loop to treat them 1 by 1
find /path/ > /tmp/file_list.txt
while read line; do cp -rp "$line" /backup/; done < /tmp/file_list.txt
